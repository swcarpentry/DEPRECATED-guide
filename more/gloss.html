        <dt id="dependency">dependency</dt>
        <dd>In a build system, a file whose state some other file depends on.  If any of a file's dependencies are newer than the file itself, the file must be updated.  A file's dependencies are also called its <a href="#prerequisite">prerequisites</a>. See also: <a href="#action">action</a>, <a href="#target">target</a>.</dd>

        <dt id="false-dependency">false dependency</dt>
        <dd class="fixsmall">definition</dd>

        <dt id="graph">graph</dt>
        <dd>A mathematical structure that consists of <a href="#node">nodes</a> connected by <a href="#arc">arcs</a>. Graphs may be directed (i.e., the arcs are unidirectional) or undirected (i.e, the arcs are bidirectional), and are used to represent everything from program structure to bus routes.</dd>

        <dt id="macro">macro</dt>
        <dd>A variable in a <a href="#makefile">Makefile</a>.</dd>

        <dt id="makefile">Makefile</dt>
        <dd>A configuration file for <a href="#bib:make">Make</a> that describes what <a href="#dependency">depends</a> on what, and how to bring things up to date.</dd>

        <dt id="pattern-rule">pattern rule</dt>
        <dd>In <a href="#bib:make">Make</a>, a rule that specifies a general way to manage an entire class of files.  For example, a pattern rule might specify how to compile any C file, rather than just a particular C file.  Pattern rules typically make use of <a href="#automatic-variable">automatic variables</a>.</dd>

        <dt id="phony-target">phony target</dt>
        <dd>In a build system, a <a href="#target">target</a> that does not correspond to a file or other object.  Phony targets are usually just symbolic names for sequences of actions.</dd>

        <dt id="prerequisite">prerequisite</dt>
        <dd>In a build system, a file whose state some other file depends on.  If any of a file's prerequisites are newer than the file itself, the file must be updated.  A file's prerequisites are also called its <a href="#dependency">dependencies</a>. See also: <a href="#action">action</a>, <a href="#target">target</a>.</dd>

        <dt id="rule">rule</dt>
        <dd>In a build system, a specification of a <a href="#target">target</a>'s <a href="#prerequisite">prerequisites</a>, and what <a href="#action">action(s)</a> to take to bring the <a href="#target">target</a> up to date.</dd>

        <dt id="target">target</dt>
        <dd>In a build system, a thing that may be created or updated. Targets typically have <a href="#prerequisite">prerequisites</a> that must be up to date before the target itself can be updated.  Targets may also be symbolic, i.e., there may be targets that do not correspond to files or other objects.  In this case, the target is simply a symbolic name for a set of actions. See also: <a href="#action">action</a>, <a href="#default-target">default target</a>, <a href="#dependency">dependency</a>, <a href="#phony-target">phony target</a>.</dd>
