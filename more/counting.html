        <h3>How Long is a File?</h3>

        <p>
          Why do we need to count lines ourselves?
          Why can't we simply use:
        </p>

<pre>
num_lines = len(reader)
</pre>

        <p class="continue">
          The first reason is that the question is ambiguous:
          what exactly do we mean by the length of a file?
          Is it the number of bytes the file contains,
          or the number of lines of text?
          The latter isn't even a sensible question to ask
          if the file is an image or an audio clip.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some older systems use exactly the same number of characters for each line,
          so that they can count lines by dividing the length of the file by that length,
          or skip ahead a certain number of lines
          just by multiplying the line length by the number of lines to skip.
          This scheme fell out of fashion for a couple of decades,
          but is making something of a comeback in databases and other high-performance systems.

      <h2>Provenance Once Again</h2>

      <p>
        We now know enough to build a simple data provenance system on top of that.
        Again,
        suppose that Aurora's data looks like this:
      </p>

<pre>
# Cochlear test data
Experiment-Date: 2012-10-29
Experiment-Site: Hornings Mills
8.3
7.2
9.6
4.0
8.2
7.0
</pre>

      <p>
        Let's modify the comment to be something more useful:
      </p>

<pre>
# Cochlear test data <span class="highlight">$Revision: 143$</span>
Experiment-Date: 2012-10-29
Experiment-Site: Hornings Mills
8.3
7.2
9.6
4.0
8.2
7.0
</pre>

      <p>
        Why make this change?
        Because now any program that reads this data file will know what version of that file it has,
        <em>and can copy that version number forward to its output</em>.
        Here's our new code:
      </p>

<pre>
reader = file("data.txt", "r")
data = []
for line in reader:

    # Comment.
    if line[0] == '#':
        if "$Revision:" in line:
            print line.rstrip()
        else:
            pass

    # Blank line.
    elif line.strip() == '':
        pass

    # Information about experiment.
    elif ':' in line:
        pass

    # Data.
    else:
        value = float(line)
        data.append(value)

reader.close()
print sum(data) / len(data)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        If we run this program on our sample data file,
        its output is:
      </p>

<pre>
# Cochlear test data $Revision: 143$
44.3
</pre>

      <p>
        It's a small change,
        but a significant one,
        because now our output tell us something about where it came from.
        We still only know the revision number of the input, though,
        not what the input file actually was.
      </p>

<pre>
reader = file("data.txt", "r")
data = []
for line in reader:

    # Information to be copied forward.
    if line.startswith('#') and '$' in line:
        print line.rstrip()

    # Comment.
    elif line[0] == '#':
        pass

    # Blank line.
    elif line.strip() == '':
        pass

    # Information about experiment.
    elif ':' in line:
        pass

    # Data.
    else:
        value = float(line)
        data.append(value)

reader.close()

      <p>
        Let's make one more change to our program:
      </p>

<pre>
version = "$Id: lists.html 2597 2012-04-14 00:47:19Z gvw $"

print "# Program", version
reader = file("data.txt", "r")
data = []
for line in reader:

    # Information to be copied forward.
    if line.startswith('#') and '$' in line:
        print line.rstrip()

    # Blank line.
    elif line.strip() == '':
        pass

    # Comment.
    elif line[0] == '#':
        pass

    # Information about experiment.
    elif ':' in line:
        pass

    # Data.
    else:
        value = float(line)
        data.append(value)

reader.close()
print sum(data) / len(data)
</pre>

      <p>
        Doing everything by hand is a lot of work, though.
        What we really want is some way to make this happen consistently
        in all our programs
        without any duplicated code.
        How to achieve that is the subject of
        <a href="funclib.html">the next chapter</a>.
