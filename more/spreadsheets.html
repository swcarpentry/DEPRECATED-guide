      A spreadsheet is a tool for performing computations on tables of data.
      They're most useful when your data is numeric, and organized into rows and columns.
      We will use Microsoft Excel for our examples,
      since it is by far the most popular spreadsheet among scientists.
      Open source alternatives like OpenOffice Calc and Gnumeric have similar features,
      as do newer web-based tools like the Google Docs spreadsheets.

      <h2>Basic Operation</h2>

      <p>
        We will use Canadian CO2 emissions as a running example in this chapter.
        Our spreadsheet looks like this:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/initial.png" alt="Initial Spreadsheet" />

      <p class="continue">
        Each rectangle in a spreadsheet is called a <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#cell">cell</a>.
        Cells can contains numbers, dates, plain text, or a wide variety of other kinds of data.
        Information for each province and territory is in a single row;
        the columns hold their areas, populations, and CO2 emissions for 1990 and 2008.
        Nothing requires us to organize our data this way&mdash;we
        could scatter values wherever we wanted&mdash;but organizing things by row and column
        makes information easier to input, easier to update, and easier to find.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those CO2 emissions are measured in megatons.
        If we want the 2008 values in kilotons, we can put formulas in cells to do the conversions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll start by adding a heading for our new emissions column in cell F1.
        We want each cell in this column to contain the corresponding cell value in column E times 1000.
        For example, we want F2 to contain the value in E2 times a thousand,
        so let's put the cursor in F2 and type <code>=E2*1000</code>:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/first-formula.png" alt="First Formula" />

      <p class="continue">
        Every formula starts with an equals sign.
        As usual, <code>*</code> is the multiplication operator,
        and E2 is a <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#cell-reference">cell reference</a>:
        it means "the value located in that cell."
      </p>

      <p>
        We could emissions in kilotons for the other regions by typing a new formula for each,
        but that would be tedious,
        and we'd probably make mistakes.
        Instead, let's copy the formula in cell F2 and paste it into cell F3:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/second-formula.png" alt="Copying and Pasting a Formula" />

      <p class="continue">
        If you look at the formula bar,
        you'll see that Excel automatically changed the formula to a thousand times E3, which is what we want.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's copy it again, then select the other the cells in column F, and paste the formula into all of them at once.
        Excel automatically adjusts the cell reference in each so that F4 refers to E4, F5 to E5, and so on:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/multi-paste.png" alt="Pasting into Multiple Cells" />

      <p>
        If this was a program, we wouldn't repeat the number 1000 in each cell.
        Instead, we would put it in a variable of its own and reference that.
        We can and should do that in a spreadsheet as well.
        Let's go down to row 16 and create a new heading "megatons to kilotons"
        and put the value 1000 in cell B16:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/defining-scaling-factor.png" alt="Defining a Scaling Factor" />

      <p class="continue">
        (Excel doesn't require us to create headings,
        but it's a good habit to get into,
        since a spreadsheet with thousands of cells and no labels is pretty hard to figure out.)
        Now that the scaling factor is in one place,
        let's delete the formulas in column F and enter <code>=E2*B16</code> in cell F2:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/using-scaling-factor.png" alt="Using a Scaling Factor" />

      <p>
        That does what we want,
        but when we copy the formula and paste it into cell F3,
        we get zero instead of 244,300:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/pasting-scaling-factor.png" alt="Pasting the Scaling Factor" />

      <p class="continue">
        What's gone wrong?
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the formula bar,
        we can see that Excel has adjusted the cell references so that the formula is <code>=E3*B17</code>.
        The first change is right, but the second makes the formula refer to an empty cell.
        We can prevent the spreadsheet from adjusting the reference to B16
        by using an <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#absolute-reference">absolute reference</a>
        with a dollar sign before the column name, row number, or both.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our case, since we don't want B16 to be translated in any direction, we'll refer to it as $B$16,
        so the formula in F2 becomes <code>=E2*$B$16</code>:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/one-absolute-ref.png" alt="A Single Absolute Reference" />

      <p class="continue">
        When we copy this formula into other cells,
        Excel updates the first of the references,
        but not the second,
        which is what we want:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/paste-absolute-ref.png" alt="Copying Absolute References" />

      <p>
        If we now want emissions in tons instead of kilotons,
        all we have to do is change the value in B16 from a thousand to a million,
        and all of the cells that depend on it are automatically updated:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/changing-scaling-factor.png" alt="Changing the Scaling Factor" />

      <p class="continue">
        When we change the value back, the cells are updated again.
        This is why people use spreadsheets:
        they automatically keep track of what depends on what,
        and update things as needed whenever any values change.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="s:aggregate">

      <h2>Aggregation</h2>

      <p>
        To <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#aggregate">aggregate</a> means
        to combine several values into a single result.
        Computing the sum, average, or standard deviation of a set of values are examples of aggregation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose we want to compute total areas and emissions for all of Canada's provinces and territories.
        The total area is the sum of the values in cells B2 to B14.
        The formula we write is almost exactly what we'd say: <code>=SUM(B2:B14)</code>:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/sum-areas.png" alt="Sum of Areas" />

      <p class="continue">
        <code>SUM</code> is a function that totals the values in zero or more cells.
        The expression <code>B2:B14</code> specifies a <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#range">range</a>,
        a rectangular block of cells with column B row 2 as its top left corner,
        and column B row 14 as its bottom right.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we copy and paste the formula we just wrote and then edit the function name,
        Excel updates the cell range, which isn't what we want.
        We could use an absolute range,
        but then if we copy the formula to other columns,
        Excel <em>won't</em> update the range when we <em>do</em> want it to.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best solution is to use <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#mixed-reference">mixed references</a>
        in our range.
        If we write it as <code>B$2:B$14</code>,
        then the column (B) will be updated when we copy the formula to other locations,
        but the row limits (2&ndash;14) will not.
        Let's make this row bold and italic so that it's easier to see,
        and then calculate the minimum, average, and maximum values for column B
        using mixed references:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/mixed-reference.png" alt="Using Mixed References" />

      <p class="continue">
        We can now paste the formulas below the other columns and get the right behavior:
      </p>
        
      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/paste-mixed-reference.png" alt="Pasting Mixed References" />

      <p>
        Making formulas behave the way we want is only one of the problems we have to solve.
        Another, larger issue is to figure out what we actually want.
        Look at cell D14,
        we can see that some of our data is actually missing:
        Nunavut was part of the Northwest Territories before 1999,
        so there is no emissions data for it for 1990.
        Real-world data always has gaps like this:
        sometimes it's physically impossible, too expensive, or too dangerous to collect values,
        and sometimes, as in this case, those values don't actually exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Excel treats gaps and zeroes differently.
        For example, to compute an average, we divide the sum of the values we have by the number of values.
        Zeroes count as values, but gaps do not.
        This is why entering zero for Nunavut's CO2 emissions in 1990 changes the average emissions for that year:
        Excel is now adding up 14 values and dividing by 14,
        rather than adding up 13 values and dividing by 13.
        If we put a non-numeric value in the cell,
        such as the string "no data",
        we get the same result:
        Excel acts as if the cell was empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is easy to agree in this case that dividing by 13 is the "right" answer.
        It is much harder in others.
        For example,
        if we want to count how many Russians won Nobel Prizes in the 20th Century,
        should we include all winners from the Soviet Union,
        or only those from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic?
        Should East and West German totals be combined for the years 1945&ndash;1990?
        If so,
        should winners from regions that were part of the German Empire between 1871 and 1918
        all be counted as German,
        or should some of them be considered Czechoslovakian
        (which is problematic in its own right,
        since Czechoslovakia is now two separate countries)?
        We can only put the right formula in the right cell
        once we have decided what the right formula is.

        Our spreadsheet is small enough to easily fit on a screen,
        but others may have thousands of rows or columns.
        If we want to keep row or column headings visible as we scroll around,
        we can do so using the "Freeze Panes" feature.
        From the "View" tab, we select "Freeze Panes", and choose "Freeze Top Row":

        Let's put things back the way they were,
        then make the values more readable by changing how numbers are displayed.
        We select the cells we want to format,
        then right-click to bring up a context menu and select "Format Cells":

        Under "Category" we choose "Number",
        then change the number of decimal place to zero and tick off "Use thousands separator".
        When we click "OK" on this dialog, the cells displaying areas are reformatted:

    <section id="s:chart">

      <h2>Charting</h2>

      <p>
        Changing the way numbers are displayed improves readability,
        but if we really want to see what's in our data,
        we should create a chart.
        Excel and other spreadsheets do simple charts very well,
        though if we need something complex,
        it may be easier to write a program to drive a graph-plotting package.
        Numerical programming environments like MATLAB are a happy medium between the two,
        which is one of the many reasons they are the programming tool of choice
        for many numerical analysts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's start by selecting the population and emissions for 2008, including column headers,
        then go to the insert menu and select a scatter plot:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/create-scatter-plot.png" alt="Creating a Scatter Plot" />

      <p class="continue">
        Excel creates a plot and places it on top of our data.
        Let's go to "Layout" and add titles for the horizontal and vertical axes,
        then cut the chart,
        create a new sheet in our spreadsheet named "charts",
        and paste the chart there so that it isn't sitting on top of our data:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/scatter-plot.png" alt="A Simple Scatter Plot" />

      <p>
        This chart isn't actually very helpful because
        too many data points are crowded together in the bottom left corner.
        If we change both axes to be logarithmic rather than linear,
        we can see a clear pattern:
        emissions grow in proportion to population,
        with a couple of outliers above and below the main trend line.
        This kind of insight is what charts are for.
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/log-scatter-plot.png" alt="A Logarithmic Scatter Plot" />

      <p>
        Let's shrink our chart to make room for another one, then go back to our data.
        Select the provinces and 2008 emissions, then go to "Insert" and choose "Bar Chart".
        Once we have created it,
        let's cut it and paste it beside the other chart:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/bar-chart.png" alt="A Simple Bar Chart" />

      <p class="continue">
        At first glance it looks like there are no emissions at all
        from Prince Edward Island or the three northern territories.
        If we log-scale the emissions axis, though,
        we can see that there are columns&mdash;they're just very short compared to the others:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/log-bar-chart.png" alt="A Semi-Log Bar Chart" />

      <p class="continue">
        This highlights one of the dangers of visualization:
        how we display data determines the conclusions we're likely to draw.

    <section id="s:sort">

      <h2>Sorting</h2>

      <p>
        Our CO2 spreadsheet is currently organized geographically from west to east,
        with the northern territories tacked on at the end.
        We can make things easier to find by sorting data alphabetically.
        To do this,
        we select the range of rows we want to sort by clicking on row numbers 1 to 14,
        then go to the "Data" tab and choose "Sort".
        Under "Sort by", we choose "Name":
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose we now want to know which provinces emitted the most CO2 per capita in 2008.
        We'll start by hiding column D,
        which holds the 1990 emissions,
        so that the extra columns we're about to add will fit on the screen:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/hiding-column.png" alt="Hiding a Column" />

      <p class="continue">
        Next, we calculate emissions per capita using a formula in column F:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/emissions-per-capita.png" alt="Emissions per Capita" />

      <p class="continue">
        And then, in column G,
        we use the <code>Rank</code> function to find each cell's rank in its column.
        Its first parameter is the value whose rank we want:
        in this case, the region's emissions per capita.
        The second is the range of values we're finding that rank in:
        in our case, cells F2 to F14.
        Finally, we can specify whether the rankings are descending or ascending.
        Since we want the region with the highest emissions to be ranked first,
        we specify descending order, which is zero:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/rank-first-cell.png" alt="Ranking the First Cell" />

      <p class="continue">
        The first rank looks plausible.
        When we fill down to rank all of the regions, though, there are several ties:

      <p class="continue">
        What has gone wrong?

      <p>
        We can find out using Excel's built-in debugging tools.
        Let's select cell G2, then go to "Formulas... Formula Auditing... Trace Precedents":
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/selecting-trace-precedents.png" alt="Selecting 'Trace Precedents'" />

      <p class="continue">
        This shows all the cells referenced by the formula in the chosen cell:

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/trace-precedents-first-cell.png" alt="Immediate Precedents of First Cell" />

      <p class="continue">
        Clicking again shows the values that those cells depend on:

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/all-precedents-first-cell.png" alt="All Precedents of First Cell" />

      <p>
        That looks right, so let's clear the display with "Remove Arrows" and look at the last cell:

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/trace-precedents-second-cell.png" alt="Immediate Precedents of Second Cell" />

      <p class="continue">
        The value is being ranked in the wrong range:
        the formula used relative references rather than absolute references,
        so Excel adjusted it when we copied it.
        No matter which cell we're in, we always want to rank it in the range F2 to F14.
        If we change our formula to use absolute references and re-rank,
        our rankings look reasonable:

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/ranked-correctly.png" alt="Cells Ranked Correctly" />

      <h2>Conditionals</h2>

      <p>
        Here's a version of our spreadsheet in which
        each province and territory assigned to one of five regions:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/regions.png" alt="Territories by Region" />

      <p class="continue">
        To find how many are in each region, we can use the <code>COUNTIF</code> function.
        Its first argument is the range of cells we want to look at,
        and its second is a single value.
        Its result is the number of cells in that region that have that value,
        so <code>COUNTIF</code> of B2:B14 and the string "Western"
        is the number of provinces and territories in the west,
        while <code>COUNTIF</code> of B2:B14 and "Prairies" is the number in the Prairies,
        and so on:

        Rather than putting the region names in the formula,
        we should refer to the row headings in our formula&mdash;again,
        any data that's duplicated will eventually be wrong somewhere.
        Notice that we use an absolute reference for the range of cells that we're counting in,
        so that it isn't translated when we paste the formula,
        but a relative reference for the label,
        so that it is:

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/countif-relative.png" alt="Counting Territories with Relative References" />

      <p>
        Now let's add another column for the total CO2 emission in each region in 2008.
        To calculate this, we use the <code>SUMIF</code> function.
        Instead of counting the number of cells with a certain property,
        it adds up the values of cells in one set
        that correspond to cells in another set that pass some test.
        The first argument is the range of cells we're testing:
        in our case,
        the name of the region in column B.
        The second is what we're comparing those values to,
        which is the region name in cells A17 to A21.
        The third argument specifies the cells whose values Excel should add up:
        in our case, the emissions in column F.
        Excel only adds the ones that correspond to cells in the first range
        that are equal to the value specified as the second argument:
      </p>

        Tracing the precedents of the total emissions for the Prairie region
        may make this clearer:

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/sumif-precedents.png" alt="Precedents for SUMIF" />

      <p class="continue">
        To find the value for C18 (the total emissions for the Prairies),
        Excel has compared the value in A18 (the name "Prairies")
        to the values in the range B2:B14 (the names of the regions the territories are in).
        Wherever there is a match,
        it has added the corresponding value in column F to the total it displays&mdash;in
        this case, the values in F3, F4, and F5.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can apply multiple tests in a single function call
        using the functions <code>COUNTIFS</code> (with an "S" on the end)
        and <code>SUMIFS</code>,
        both of which take one or more pairs of arguments.
        The first argument in each pair is a range, and the second specifies the test.
        All of the ranges must have the same shape,
        i.e., the same number of cells in the same rectangular pattern.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example,
        let's count how many provinces or territories in each region
        were over their CO2 per capita limit in 2008.
        We'll hide columns C and E (the area and 1990 emissions) to make some space,
        then use a formula to calculate 2008 emissions per person in column G:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/emissions-per-capita-2008.png" alt="Emissions per Capita 2008" />

      <p class="continue">
        Now let's put our <code>COUNTIFS</code> formula in column H.
        The first range is B2 to B14, which must be equal to the region name.
        The second range is G2 to G14, which is the emissions per capita.
        These cell pass the test if their values are greater than 0.02:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/over-per-capita-2008.png" alt="Number Over Limit per Capita 2008" />

      <p>
        Notice the double quotes around the second test:
        without them,
        Excel sees "nothing &gt; 0.02" and complains that the formula is incorrect.

      <h2>Named Ranges</h2>

      <p>
        Another way to manage the data in a spreadsheet is
        to use <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#named-range">named ranges</a>.
        Let's go down to the bottom of our spreadsheet
        and insert formulas for the minimum, average, and maximum values of each column.
        The minimum area is <code>MIN(B$2:B$14)</code>,
        while the average and maximum are <code>AVERAGE</code> and <code>MAX</code> of the same range.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, your alarm bells should be ringing.
        Any time information is duplicated, it will eventually be wrong in one or more places.
        We've specified the range B2:B14 three times;
        what we <em>should</em> do is give that range of cells a name,
        so that if we ever want to change it,
        we only have to change it in one place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's erase our three formulas, then select the range of cells B2:B14.
        If we go to the upper left corner of the formula bar,
        we can give this range the name "Areas":
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/creating-named-range.png" alt="Creating a Named Range" />

      <p class="continue">
        We can now rewrite our formulas as <code>MIN(Areas)</code>,
        <code>AVERAGE(Areas)</code>, and <code>MAX(Areas)</code>:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/named-range-area.png" alt="Using Named Ranges in Formulas" />

      <p class="continue">
        Doing this guarantees that all three formulas are referring to exactly the same range of cells:
        if we typed in the range three separate times,
        we could all too easily type B2:B4 instead of B2:B14.
        It's also easier to understand, since the formula tells us we're calculating with areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using named ranges also makes it easier for us to manipulate our spreadsheet.
        If we go to the Name Manager,
        it shows us that this spreadsheet has one named range called "Areas":
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/name-manager.png" alt="The Name Manager" />

      <p class="continue">
        If we were exploring our data,
        we could change the range of cells that "Areas" refers to
        so that it only included only the Western and Prairie provinces,
        look at the aggregate values for those two regions,
        then change the range back.
        Working this way is faster and safer than editing multiple formulas.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is also possible to create
        <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#dynamic-named-range">dynamic named ranges</a>
        using the <code>OFFSET</code> function.
        Dynamic ranges automatically adjust their size to include all the values in a row or column,
        and are very useful when you're using spreadsheets to analyze experimental data.
        If we want to go even further,
        Excel can import "live" data from a Microsoft Access database,
        which allows it to serve as a graphical data analysis front-end
        for very complex data sets.

      <h2>Lookup</h2>

      <p>
        Scientists often need to classify and organize data.
        The easiest way to do this in a spreadsheet is to use a
        <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#lookup-function">lookup function</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's start by creating a small table of per capita CO2 emissions and regulatory ratings.
        The lowest rating is "minimal";
        at 0.005 megatons per capita, the rating changes to "low",
        then to "legal" at 0.01,
        and 0.02 or higher is "excessive":
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/classify.png" alt="Emission Classification Table" />

      <p>
        After hiding column D and putting emissions per capita in column F,
        we can write a formula in column G
        to give each province a rating based on the table we just created.
        This formula uses the <code>LOOKUP</code> function, which takes three arguments.
        The first is the value we're looking up&mdash;for cell G2, the value in F2.
        The second is the range we're looking in, which are the limits on each rating range in cells B16:B19.
        The values in this range must be sorted:
        Excel will check them one by one to find the largest one that is less than or equal to the search value,
        i.e., the last one that isn't greater than what we're looking for.
        The third argument is the range of values we're selecting from:
        in this case, the rating names:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/rating-one-cell.png" alt="Rating for One Cell" />

      <p>
        Sure enough,
        British Columbia's emissions per capita is legal.
        if we paste this formula into the remaining cells,
        we see that five provinces have excessive emissions,
        and that only the Yukon's rating is "low":
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/rating-all-cells.png" alt="Rating All Cells" />

      <p>
        The typical bureaucratic response to news like this is to move the goalposts,
        so let's pretend we care more about our ratings in the polls
        than the world our children are going to inherit
        and make it easier to get good ratings.
        As we raise the thresholds,
        Excel automatically re-selects ratings,
        until lo and behold,
        every single province and territory is in the legal range:

    <section id="s:pivot">

      <h2>Pivot Tables</h2>

      <p>
        Suppose we want to see how many provinces and territories in each geographical region
        fell into each of our original CO2 emission categories.
        With five regions and four categories we would have to write 20 <code>SUMIF</code> formulas,
        but we can get the answers we want with a single
        <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#pivot-table">pivot table</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To create a pivot table,
        we select all of the data that we want to include in the table,
        then go to "Insert" and choose "Pivot Table":
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/create-pivot-table.png" alt="Creating a Pivot Table" />

      <p class="continue">
        As the popup says,
        pivot tables make it easy to arrange and summarize complicated data and drill down on details.
        When we click, the dialog asks us what data we want to include in the table:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/pivot-table-dialog.png" alt="Pivot Table Creation Dialog" />

      <p class="continue">
        Since we have already selected a range of cells,
        Excel fills this in automatically.
        We can also choose whether to put the pivot table in a new worksheet or add it to an existing one.
        We'll do the former so that everything fits on one screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we click "OK", Excel creates a new worksheet and inserts a placeholder for our table.
        It also creates a list of the titles in our columns.
        Let's drag the "Region" title to the "Column Labels" field,
        and then drag "Rating" to "Row Labels":
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/partial-pivot-table.png" alt="Partially-Created Pivot Table" />

      <p class="continue">
        Our pivot table now has one column for each of the unique regions,
        and a row for each of the ratings that actually appear in the data.
        Since no province or territory has an "excessive" rating at the moment,
        there isn't a row for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's drag the "Territory" heading to the "&Sigma;&nbsp;Values" field.
        As soon as we drop it, Excel fills in the pivot table:
      </p>

      <img src="../img/spreadsheets/completed-pivot-table.png" alt="Completed Pivot Table" />

      <p class="continue">
        The value for column "Northern" and row "low" is
        the number of cells with "Northern" in the "Region" column of the original data
        and "low" in the "Rating" column.
        In other words,
        Excel has treated each row of the original data as a record,
        and counted how many records belong in each cell of the pivot table.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pivot tables can do more than just count entries;
        they can also calculate averages and other <a href="#s:aggregate">aggregate values</a>.
        One thing they <em>can't</em> easily do is handle more than two dimensions' worth of data.
        If we want to analyze medical data by year, region, gender, and blood type,
        we must either do it two axes at a time,
        or switch to a more sophisticated tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another thing they don't do (at least not by default) is update themselves automatically.
        If we go back to the worksheet that holds our data
        and change the rating boundaries to their politicized levels,
        the counts in the pivot table do <em>not</em> change
        until we right-click on the pivot table's title and select "Refresh".
        This default behavior has been a source of head-scratching,
        and eventually foul language,
        for more than a few scientists.
