    <p>
      Once upon a time (actually, the late 1960s),
      a group of scientists at MIT led by Seymour Papert
      were exploring new ways of teaching and learning mathematics and programming.
      As part of their work,
      they built robotic "turtles" that could be controlled by simple computer programs.
      Turtles could move forward or backward and turn left or right;
      each one also had a pen,
      which it could raise or lower to draw on a sheet of paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      As simple as they were,
      these turtles turned out to be a wonderful way to help children discover mathematics.
      The core ideas have since been reproduced in many different programming languages,
      from Logo (another of Papert's creations)
      to the Python <code>turtle</code> library we will use in this chapter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our real goal is not to explore mathematics, though.
      Instead,
      we are going to use turtles to introduce
      yet another way to structure large (and small) programs.
      This technique is called
      <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#object-oriented-programming">object-oriented programming</a> (OOP),
      because it encourages programmers to build programs out of small, interchangeable components,
      each of which does a few things, and <em>only</em> a few things.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have been using objects since our first programming exercise:
      strings, lists, files, and so on are all objects.
      (Even numbers are objects,
      albeit very plain ones.)
      After a quick introduction to turtle graphics,
      we will look at how to create objects of our own,
      and then at how to figure out what objects we ought to create.
    </p>

    <section id="s:turtle">

      <h2>Turtles All the Way Down</h2>

      <p>
        Let's start with a simple program:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/straight-line.py">
from turtle import *
forward(50)
mainloop()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        If everything is installed correctly,
        a small window should open on your screen
        showing a straight black arrow from left to right.
        Let's add a few more commands:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/red-right-angle.py">
from turtle import *
pencolor("red")
forward(50)
left(90)
forward(50)
mainloop()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        This one should show a right-angle turn
        with a black-on-red arrowhead at its upper right end.
        Let's go through the program line by line to see what it does:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The first line imports all the commands in the <code>turtle</code> library.
          (We'll be a bit more selective about our imports later on.)
        </li>
        <li>
          The next line tells the library that we want to draw with a red pen
          rather than the default black.
          If we run the first and second command interactively,
          this is the point at which the drawing window will open up:
          the library automatically creates the window
          as soon as there's something worth drawing.
        </li>
        <li>
          That <code>pencolor</code> command implicitly applies to
          the default turtle that the library creates.
          This command tells that turtle to move forward 50 units.
          Since the turtle's pen is down by default,
          and since the turtle starts life facing due east,
          this draws a horizontal red line.
        </li>
        <li>
          As you can probably guess,
          <code>left(90)</code> tells the turtle to turn left 90&deg;,
          which in this case makes it point north.
          If we run these commands interactively,
          we can actually see the turtle rotate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeating the <code>forward(50)</code> command
          makes the turtle draw another straight line.
          Since its heading has changed,
          though,
          this line goes north,
          making the vertical leg of our backward 'L'.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final <code>mainloop</code> call is needed
          to keep the drawing window open on the screen.
          Without it,
          the program will finish as soon as the leg of the 'L' is drawn,
          and the picture will disappear.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        And that's basically it.
        The library does provide functions to move the turtle backward,
        make it turn right instead of left,
        and so on,
        but we already have enough to create some interesting pictures:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/spirograph.py">
from turtle import *

def box(length):
    for i in range(4):
        forward(length)
        left(90)

def fan(count, length):
    for i in range(count):
        box(length)
        left(22.5)
        length *= 0.8

fan(8, 100)
mainloop()
</pre>

      <p>
        We can also use turtle graphics to explore some interesting physical problems,
        but before we do that,
        let's go back and clean up a little bit.
        The functions we have seen so far all operate on a default turtle
        that we didn't create.
        Let's create a turtle of our own instead,
        and then call its methods instead of calling functions that work by magic:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/create-turtle.py">
from turtle import Turtle, mainloop

def box(t, length):
    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(length)
        t.left(90)

def fan(t, count, length):
    for i in range(count):
        box(t, length)
        t.left(22.5)
        length *= 0.8

t = Turtle()
fan(t, 8, 100)
mainloop()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        That's better:
        we create a turtle,
        then pass it to our functions,
        each of which then asks that turtle to move or turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why is this better?
        Well, suppose we are studying the mathematics of pursuit and evasion,
        i.e.,
        what happens when a velociraptor chases a hadrosaur.
        The logical way to simulate this is to create one turtle to represent the velociraptor,
        and another for its duck-billed prey.
        Let's build up to that in stages.
        First,
        we'll create and position the two dinosaurs:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/position-dinosaurs.py">
from turtle import Turtle, mainloop

raptor = Turtle()
raptor.pencolor("red")
raptor.backward(200)

duckbill = Turtle()
duckbill.pencolor("green")
duckbill.forward(200)

mainloop()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        Whoops: we didn't want to draw lines while moving them into position.
        Let's raise their pens while positioning them,
        then lower the pens again for drawing:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/raise-lower-pens.py">
from turtle import Turtle, mainloop

raptor = Turtle()
raptor.pencolor("red")
raptor.penup()
raptor.backward(200)
raptor.pendown()

duckbill = Turtle()
duckbill.pencolor("green")
duckbill.penup()
duckbill.forward(200)
duckbill.pendown()

mainloop()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        Of course,
        since we're doing almost exactly the same thing twice,
        we should refactor the shared code into a function:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/initialize-func.py">
from turtle import Turtle, mainloop

def setup(color, distance):
    t = Turtle()
    t.pencolor(color)
    t.penup()
    t.forward(distance)
    t.pendown()
    return t

raptor = setup("red", -200)
duckbill = setup("green", 200)

mainloop()
</pre>

      <p>
        Now let's make the velociraptor chase the hadrosaur.
        We'll assume their velocities are constant and equal:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/constant-chase.py">
from turtle import Turtle, mainloop

def setup(color, distance):
    ...as before...

raptor = setup("red", -200)
duckbill = setup("green", 200)

for i in range(20):
    raptor.forward(10)
    duckbill.forward(10)

mainloop()
</pre>

      <p>
        So far, so boring.
        But what if we change things a bit?
        What if the duckbill is running due north,
        and the raptor keeps changing direction toward it?
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/right-angle-change.py">
raptor = setup("red", -200)
duckbill = setup("green", 200)
duckbill.left(90)

for i in range(80):
    target = duckbill.pos()
    angle = raptor.towards(target)
    raptor.setheading(angle)
    raptor.forward(5)
    duckbill.forward(5)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        This is much more interesting:
        at each timestep,
        we change the raptor's heading to point it at the current position of the duckbill,
        then move both dinosaurs forward.
        (We've dropped the distance moved in each step to produce a smoother curve.)
        The result is an asymptotic approach curve;
        for bonus marks,
        try to figure out how close the raptor comes to the duckbill at t<sub>&#8734;</sub>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's try one more chase before we move on.
        This time,
        we'll have the hadrosaur run in a circle.
        We'll also give it a bit of a speed advantage over the raptor:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/running-in-circle.py">

raptor = setup("red", -200)
duckbill = setup("green", 200)
duckbill.left(90)

for i in range(240):
    # Move the velociraptor toward the hadrosaur.
    target = duckbill.pos()
    angle = raptor.towards(target)
    raptor.setheading(angle)
    raptor.forward(5)

    # Move the hadrosaur in a circle.
    duckbill.forward(8)
    duckbill.left(6)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        It looks like the raptor has settled down into a circle inside the duckbill's orbit;
        does that always happen?
        Let's refactor this program to put the movement instructions in functions:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/circle-refactored.py">
def move_raptor(raptor, duckbill, distance):
    target = duckbill.pos()
    angle = raptor.towards(target)
    raptor.setheading(angle)
    raptor.forward(distance)

def move_duckbill(duckbill, distance, angle):
    duckbill.forward(distance)
    duckbill.left(angle)

raptor = setup("red", -200)
duckbill = setup("green", 200)
duckbill.left(90)

for i in range(240):
    move_raptor(raptor, duckbill, 5)
    move_duckbill(duckbill, 8, 6)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        (remember, refactoring doesn't change what the program does, just how it does it),
        and then add some more raptors of varying speeds:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/flock-pursuit.py">
Raptor_Specs = [
    ["red",    5],
    ["orange", 7],
    ["yellow", 9]
]

raptors = []
for (color, speed) in Raptor_Specs:
    r = setup(color, -200)
    raptors.append(r)

duckbill = setup("green", 200)
duckbill.left(90)

for i in range(240):
    for i in range(len(Raptor_Specs)):
        speed = Raptor_Specs[i][1]
        move_raptor(raptors[i], duckbill, speed)
    move_duckbill(duckbill, 8, 6)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        There are two things to notice about this program:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          It looks like the raptor's path might almost be forming a cusp
          when its speed is just a little bit less than the duckbill's.
        </li>
        <li>
          This code is becoming unwieldy.
          We have to be careful to pass raptors and hadrosaurs to the right functions,
          keep track of which raptor is moving at what speed,
          and so on.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        What we really need is some way to combine
        the functions that operate on different kinds of dinosaurs
        with each dinosaur's data.
        That's where objects come in.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="s:encapsulation">

      <h2>Keeping Track of Colors</h2>

      <p>
        The two basic concepts in object-oriented programming are
        the <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#class">class</a>
        and the <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#object">object</a>.
        A class defines a new kind of thing:
        more specifically,
        what information it has,
        and what kinds of things it can do.
        An object is then a particular thing with a particular set of properties
        that behaves the way its class tells it to.
      </p>

      <p>
        This probably seems hopelessly vague, so let's look at an analogy with biology.
        There, the general category is the species,
        such as <em>Velociraptor mongoliensis</em>,
        and the specific "thing" is a particular raptor like Cuddles here.
        The species keeps track of things like gait (it's bipedal) and diet (carnivorous),
        while Cuddles herself keeps track of things like her current position.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's create a new class to keep track of our dinosaurs:
      </p>

<pre src="src/oop/naked-object.py">
class Dinosaur(object):
    pass

cuddles = Dinosaur()
print "type(cuddles):", type(cuddles)
<span class="out">type(cuddles): &lt;class '__main__.Dinosaur'&gt;</span>

cuddles.species = "Velociraptor mongoliensis"
cuddles.color = "red"
cuddles.speed = 8
print "Cuddles is a", cuddles.color, cuddles.species
<span class="out">Cuddles is a red Velociraptor mongoliensis</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        We define a new class using the keyword <code>class</code>,
        followed by the name of the new class.
        Our new class is a kind of object,
        so we put the word <code>object</code> in parentheses after the class's name;
        we'll come back and explain why in the <a href="#s:inheritance">next section</a>.
        Finally,
        we use the keyword <code>pass</code> to indicate that
        our new class doesn't have any special data or capabilities just yet;
        we'll fix this in a few paragraphs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a class has been defined,
        we can create objects of that class
        by using the class's name as if it were a function.
        We have done this before,
        for example,
        when we create new turtles using <code>Turtle()</code>.
        Given an object,
        Python's built-in <code>type</code> function will tell us what class it belongs to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once we have created a new dinosaur,
        we can store values in it by assigning to <code>cuddles.color</code>,
        <code>cuddles.species</code>,
        and so on.
        The values stored by an object are called its <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#member">member variables</a>,
        or just "members" for short.
        <span class="fixme">memory diagram</span>
        In our example,
        <code>cuddles</code> has three members:
        <code>species</code> and <code>color</code> are strings,
        while <code>speed</code> is an integer.
        If we want to make Cuddles go faster or slower,
        we just assign a new value to <code>cuddles.speed</code>:
        it's a variable like any other
        that just happens to be stored inside an object.
      </p>

      <p>
        But why use four lines of code to create a dinosaur when one will do?
        Let's change our class so that we can create a new object,
        and initialize its member variables,
        in a single step:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/constructor.py">
class Dinosaur(object):
    def __init__(self, my_species, my_color, my_speed):
        self.species = my_species
        self.color = my_color
        self.speed = my_speed

cuddles = Dinosaur("Velociraptor mongoliensis", "red", 8)
print "Cuddles is a", cuddles.color, cuddles.species
<span class="out">Cuddles is a red Velociraptor mongoliensis</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        This code is actually easiest to understand if we go through it backward.
        We want to be able to refer to <code>cuddles.color</code>,
        <code>cuddles.species</code>, and so on in the last line.
        In order to do that,
        we have to give our object members with those names,
        so we pass the values for those members as arguments to
        the call to <code>Dinosaur(...)</code>,
        just as we would pass arguments to any other function.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order for that to work,
        we need a way to define a function that Python will run
        when it's creating a new dinosaur.
        Such a function is called a <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#constructor">constructor</a>.
        In Python,
        we create a constructor for a class
        by defining a function called <code>__init__</code> inside the class.
        This function must always have exactly that name
        so that Python knows to call it when constructing a new object.
        Its argument are the values that we want to use to initialize the object:
        in this case, the new dinosaur's species, color, and speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is <code>self</code>?
        It's the object we're in the process of creating&mdash;the thing that will contain
        the new member variables we're about to define.
        In practice,
        when we call:
      </p>

<pre>
Dinosaur("Velociraptor mongoliensis", "red", 8)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        what Python is doing behind the scenes is:
      </p>

<pre>
temp = ...make a new empty object of type Dinosaur...
Dinosaur.__init__(temp, "Velociraptor mongoliensis", "red", 8)
</pre>

      <p>
        That expression <code>Dinosaur.__init__(...)</code> should be familiar by now:
        it looks exactly like a method call because it <em>is</em> a method call.
        Let's go back and give our dinosaur another method:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/method.py">
class Dinosaur(object):
    def __init__(self, my_species, my_color, my_speed):
        self.species = my_species
        self.color = my_color
        self.speed = my_speed

    def stats(self):
        return "%s %s with speed %d" % (self.color, self.species, self.speed)

cuddles = Dinosaur("Velociraptor mongoliensis", "red", 8)
print "Cuddles is a", cuddles.stats()
<span class="out">Cuddles is a red Velociraptor mongoliensis with speed 8</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        Again, we have to give the method <code>stats</code> an extra argument
        (which doesn't actually have to be called <code>self</code>,
        but that's what everybody calls it)
        so that inside <code>stats</code> we'll know which dinosaur we're talking about.
        This is what lets us do:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/method.py">
stumbles = Dinosaur("Saurolophus osborni", "blue", 10)
print "Stumbles is a", stumbles.stats()
<span class="out">Stumbles is a blue Saurolophus osborni with speed 10</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        With classes and objects in hand,
        we can go back and clean up some of our earlier program.
        We'll start by defining a class to represent hadrosaurs running in circles:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/object-duckbill.py">
from turtle import Turtle, mainloop

class Duckbill(object):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed, angle):
        self.turtle = Turtle()
        self.turtle.pencolor(color)
        self.speed = speed

        Again,
        this code makes the most sense if we read it from the bottom up.
        What we want to be able to do is
        create a hadrosaur with a single line of code,
        then tell that hadrosaur to move itself
        <em>without having to keep track of how it's going to do that</em>.
        That qualification is the whole point of object-oriented programming:
        we want to set things up so that we don't have to worry about
        the details of how hadrosaurs move&mdash;not even
        the information the hadrosaur needs in order to move.
        All we have to do once the hadrosaur is created is say, "Hadrosaur, move thyself."
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course,
        nothing is free:
        in order to have hadrosaurs move themselves,
        we have to give them the information they need to do that,
        and make sure they're in the right starting place.
        That's where the constructor comes in:
        it creates the turtle that the hadrosaur will use to draw itself,
        positions that turtle,
        and stores the information the hadrosaur will need later on.

      <p>
        It's a bit annoying to have to type <code>self.turtle.forward</code>,
        <code>self.turtle.left</code>,
        and so on.
        Let's change our <code>Duckbill</code> class so that isn't necessary:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/inherit-duckbill.py">
from turtle import Turtle, mainloop

class Duckbill(<span class="highlight">Turtle</span>):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed, angle):
        <span class="highlight">Turtle.__init__(self)</span>
        self.pencolor(color)
        self.speed = speed
        self.angle = angle

        self.penup()
        self.forward(distance)
        self.pendown()
        self.left(90)

    def move(self):
        self.forward(self.speed)
        self.left(self.angle)

duckbill = Duckbill(200, "green", 8, 6)

for i in range(120):
    duckbill.move()

mainloop()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        The two key changes are highlighted.
        First,
        instead of putting the name <code>object</code> in parentheses
        when we are defining <code>Duckbill</code>,
        we put the name <code>Turtle</code>.
        This is our way of telling Python that a duckbill isn't just any old object:
        we want it to <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#inheritance">inherit</a>
        everything that was defined for <code>Turtle</code>.
        It's like saying that a wolf is a mammal:
        that immediately implies that wolves are warm-blooded,
        give birth to live young,
        nurse them,
        and so on.
        Similarly,
        when we say that a <code>Duckbill</code> is a <code>Turtle</code>
        it means that any object of class <code>Duckbill</code>
        automatically gets methods like <code>penup</code>,
        <code>forward</code>,
        <code>left</code>,
        and everything else that <code>Turtle</code> objects have.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why we need that funny line:
      </p>

<pre>
        <span class="highlight">Turtle.__init__(self)</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        inside <code>Duckbill</code>'s constructor.
        In order for a duckbill to work properly,
        all the things it inherits from <code>Turtle</code> must be set up properly.
        The code to set up a <code>Turtle</code> is in that class's constructor,
        <code>Turtle.__init__</code>,
        so we have to be sure to call that.
        We also have to remember to pass in <code>self</code>,
        the object being constructed.
      </p>

      <p class="fixme">memory model here</p>

      <p>
        Now that we have a class for duckbills,
        let's create a class for raptors.
        We start the same way:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/object-raptor-1.py">
class Raptor(object):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed):
        self.turtle = Turtle()
        self.turtle.pencolor(color)
        self.speed = speed

        self.turtle.penup()
        self.turtle.forward(distance)
        self.turtle.pendown()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        This is almost exactly the same as <code>Duckbill</code>'s constructor:
        the only difference is that we're not recording an angle,
        and we're not turning the raptor 90&deg; when we position it.
        Can we share this code somewhow?
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer is yes,
        and the way to do it is once again to use inheritance.
        Let's create a new class called <code>Dinosaur</code> to hold the shared code:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/object-raptor-2.py">
class Dinosaur(Turtle):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed):
        Turtle.__init__(self)
        self.pencolor(color)
        self.speed = speed
        self.penup()
        self.forward(distance)
        self.pendown()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        When a duckbill initializes itself,
        it does everything in this list of instructions,
        but also records its turning angle,
        and turns itself 90&deg; at the start:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/object-raptor-2.py">
class Duckbill(Dinosaur):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed, angle):
        Dinosaur.__init__(self, distance, color, speed)
        self.angle = angle
        self.left(90)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        To move,
        a duckbill goes forward a certain amount,
        then turns a certain amount:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/object-raptor-2.py">
class Duckbill(Dinosaur):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed, angle):
        ...as above...

    def move(self):
        self.forward(self.speed)
        self.left(self.angle)
</pre>

      <p>
        What about velociraptors?
        They don't do anything extra to initialize themselves,
        so their constructor just says,
        "Do whatever a <code>Dinosaur</code> does."
        To move,
        though,
        a raptor needs to know what it's chasing:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/object-raptor-2.py">
class Raptor(Dinosaur):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed):
        Dinosaur.__init__(self, distance, color, speed)

    def move(self, target):
        angle = self.towards(target)
        self.setheading(angle)
        self.forward(self.speed)
</pre>

      <p>
        With these classes in hand,
        the main body of our program becomes a <em>lot</em> easier to read:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/object-raptor-2.py">
duckbill = Duckbill(200, "green", 8, 6)
raptor = Raptor(-200, "red", 7.5)
for i in range(120):
    raptor.move(duckbill.pos())
    duckbill.move()
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        This is one reason we use classes and objects:
        they make programs easier to understand.
        If two types of things behave more or less the same way,
        we put the stuff that's the same in a class
        so that we only have to think about it once.
        And if we don't need to know the details of how something moves,
        we put the commands to move it in a method,
        then ask the object to move itself.
        Yes,
        creating classes requires a bit of work,
        but the larger or more complicated the program,
        the greater the payoff.

    <section id="s:polymorphism">

      <h2>If It Walks Like a Turtle...</h2>

      <p>
        Hiding details inside objects helps in another way as well:
        it lets us replace one object with another
        without changing the rest of the program.
        This is called <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#polymorphism">polymorphism</a>,
        which means, "Having more than one form,"
        and is exactly like swapping one resistor for another in a circuit board.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example,
        suppose that we want to see whether smarter velociraptors
        will actually catch more hadrosaurs.
        To do this,
        we want to create a new <code>SmartRaptor</code> class
        whose <code>move</code> method looks at where its prey is going to be
        and tries to move to there.
      </p>

      <p>
        But wait a second:
        who should calculate the hadrosaur's next position?
        And where should this calculation take place?
        <code>SmartRaptor</code> could look at
        <code>Duckbill</code>'s current position and heading
        and do the math itself,
        but then if we change how the duckbills move,
        we'll have to remember to update the <code>SmartRaptor</code> class as well.
        There's a good chance we'll forget to do this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead,
        we should give <code>Duckbill</code> a new method to report its next position.
        We can then call that method and pass the result into <code>SmartRaptor</code> as its target,
        so that the main body of our program looks like this:
      </p>

<pre>
duckbill = Duckbill(200, "green", 8, 6)
raptor = Raptor(-200, "red", 7.5)
smart_raptor = SmartRaptor(-200, "orange", 7.5)
for i in range(120):
    raptor.move(duckbill.pos())
    smart_raptor.move(duckbill.next_pos())
    duckbill.move()
</pre>

      <p>
        The upside of this design is that
        we don't actually need to define a new class for smart raptors:
        <code>SmartRaptor.move</code> is exactly the same as <code>Raptor.move</code>,
        it just takes a different value as its target.
        But that's also the downside of this design,
        and it's a big one:
        once again,
        the program that uses the object has to do something different for that object,
        which makes the code more fragile.
      </p>

      <p>
        The right answer is to go back and change our <code>Raptor</code> class
        so that its <code>move</code> method takes the duckbill the raptor is chasing as an argument,
        and moves toward that:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/smart-raptor.py">
class Raptor(Dinosaur):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed):
        Dinosaur.__init__(self, distance, color, speed)

    def move(self, target):
        angle = self.towards(target.pos())
        self.setheading(angle)
        self.forward(self.speed)

...

duckbill = Duckbill(200, "green", 8, 6)
raptor = Raptor(-200, "red", 7.5)
...
for i in range(120):
    raptor.move(duckbill)
    ...
    duckbill.move()
</pre>

      <p>
        The smart raptor class is now almost the same:
        it just asks the target
        (which is now the hadrosaur itself)
        for its next position:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/smart-raptor.py">
class SmartRaptor(Dinosaur):
    def __init__(self, distance, color, speed):
        Dinosaur.__init__(self, distance, color, speed)

    def move(self, target):
        angle = self.towards(<span class="highlight">target.next_pos()</span>)
        self.setheading(angle)
        self.forward(self.speed)
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        Our main loop is now:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/smart-raptor.py">
duckbill = Duckbill(200, "green", 8, 6)
raptor = Raptor(-200, "red", 7.5)
<span class="highlight">smart_raptor = SmartRaptor(-200, "orange", 7.5)</span>
for i in range(120):
    raptor.move(duckbill)
    <span class="highlight">smart_raptor.move(duckbill)</span>
    duckbill.move()
</pre>

      <p>
        It's now time for the payoff.
        Once we have created a smart raptor,
        we do exactly the same things with it as we do with a regular raptor.
        The two objects are interchangeable,
        or,
        in programming jargon,
        polymorphic.
        We can therefore do things like this:
      </p>

<pre src="../src/oop/smart-raptor-polymorphic.py">
duckbill = Duckbill(200, "green", 8, 6)
raptors = [Raptor(-200, "red", 7.5),
           SmartRaptor(-200, "orange", 7.5)]
for i in range(120):
    for r in raptors:
        r.move(duckbill)
    duckbill.move()
</pre>

      <p>
        We can now create any kind of predator we want.
        As long as it has a <code>move</code> method
        that takes a hadrosaur as an argument,
        all we have to do is add it to our list
        and the main body of our program won't need to be changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can go even further.
        The raptor classes <code>move</code> methods don't actually care
        if its argument is a hadrosaur or not.
        They only care whether the things they're chasing
        have methods called <code>pos</code> and <code>next_pos</code>.
        We have actually created a plug-and-play system where
        the things on the left and the things on the right
        are almost completely insulated from each other:
      </p>

      <p class="fixme">picture</p>

      <p>
        Once again,
        the real benefits are that we can now
        ignore most of our program at any given time,
        and replace things incrementally without changing anything else.

      <p>
        Deciding which class does what is clearly the key
        to writing object-oriented programs;
        what's the best way to do that?
        In particular,
        how do you come up with an initial guess of the classes you need?
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the best ways is to write a paragraph or two about how the program will work,
        then go through it circling the major nouns and verbs.
        The nouns turn into classes;
        the verbs become their methods.
        Once they have those,
        many programmers use <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#crc-cards">CRC cards</a>.
        The acronym stands for "class, responsibility, collaborator."
        These are just standard 3&times;5 index cards
        (the kind you might use to write down a recipe)
        divided into three parts.
        At the top is the name of the class;
        on the left is a point-form description of what the class can do (its responsibilities),
        and on the right is a list of the other classes it interacts with.
      </p>

      <p class="fixme">picture of CRC cards</p>

      <p>
        When you are designing a program
        (either on your own or with other people),
        you lay the cards out on a table and talk through your program's execution.
        As you do so,
        move the cards around,
        scribble on them,
        throw them away and replace them with new ones, and so on.
        CRC cards are deliberately simple so that you <em>won't</em> take them too seriously,
        and won't hesitate to change your design
        because it took two hours to create all of the diagrams and PowerPoint slides
        that document the current one.
