      <h2>Working Remotely</h2>
  
      <p>
        Let's take a closer look at what happens when we use a desktop or laptop computer.
        The first step is to log in
        so that the operating system knows who we are and what we're allowed to do.
        We do this by typing our username and password;
        the operating system checks those values against its records,
        and if they match,
        runs a shell for us.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        As we type commands,
        the 1's and 0's that represent the characters we're typing are sent from the keyboard to the shell.
        The shell displays those characters on the screen to represent what we type,
        and then,
        if what we typed was a command,
        the shell executes it and displays its output (if any).
      </p>

      <img src="img/web/direct-shell-usage.png" alt="Direct Shell Usage" />

      <p>
        What if we want to run some commands on another machine,
        such as the server in the basement that manages our database of experimental results?
        To do this,
        we have to first log in to that machine.
        We call this a <a class="gdef" href="gloss.html#remote-login">remote login</a>,
        and the other computer a remote computer.
        Once we do this,
        everything we type is passed to a shell running on the remote computer.
        That shell interacts runs those commands on our behalf,
        just as a local shell would,
        then sends back output for our computer to display:
      </p>

      <img src="img/web/remote-shell-usage.png" alt="Remote Shell Usage" />
  
      <p>
        The tool we use to log in remotely is the <a class="gdef" href="gloss.html#secure-shell">secure shell</a>, or SSH.
        In particular, the command <code>ssh username@computer</code>
        runs SSH and connects to the remote computer we have specified.
        After we log in,
        we can use the remote shell to use the remote computer's files and directories.
        Typing <code>exit</code> or <span class="in">Control-D</span>
        terminates the remote shell and returns us to our previous shell.
        In the example below, we use highlighting to show our interaction with the remote shell.
        We can also see that the remote machine's command prompt is <code>moon&gt;</code>
        instead of just <code>$</code>,
        and that it took Vlad a couple of tries to remember his password:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$ <span class="in">ssh vlad@moon</span>
<span class="highlight"><span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ***</span>
<span class="err">Access denied</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
moon> <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/home/vlad</span>
moon> <span class="in">ls -F</span>
<span class="out">bin/     cheese.txt   dark_side/   rocks.cfg</span>
moon> <span class="in">exit</span></span>
$ <span class="in">pwd</span>
<span class="out">/users/vlad</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        The secure shell is called "secure" to contrast it with an older program called <code>rsh</code>,
        which stood for "remote shell".
        Back in the day,
        when everyone trusted each other and knew every chip in their computer by its first name,
        people didn't encrypt anything except the most sensitive information when sending it over a network.
        However,
        that meant that villains could watch network traffic,
        steal usernames and passwords,
        and use them for all manner of nefarious purposes.
        SSH was invented to prevent this (or at least slow it down).
        It uses several sophisticated, and heavily tested, encryption protocols
        to ensure that outsiders can't see what's in the messages
        going back and forth between different computers.
        A <a href="security.html">later chapter</a> will talk about how this works,
        and how secure it really is.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        <code>ssh</code> has a companion program called <code>scp</code>,
        which stands for "secure copy".
        It allows us to copy files to or from a remote computer using the same kind of connection as SSH.
        The syntax is a simple mix of <code>cp</code>'s and <code>ssh</code>'s.
        To copy a file,
        we specify the source and destination paths,
        either of which may include computer names.
        If we leave out a computer name,
        <code>scp</code> assumes we mean the machine we're running on.
        For example,
        this command copies our latest results to the backup server in the basement,
        printing out its progress as it does so:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">scp results.dat vlad@backupserver:backups/results-2011-11-11.dat</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="out">results.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        Copying a whole directory is similar:
        we just use the <code>-r</code> option to signal that we want copying to be recursive.
        For example,
        this command copies all of our results from the backup server to our laptop:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">scp -r vlad@backupserver:backups ./backups</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-09-18.dat              100%  7  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-10-04.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-10-28.dat              100%  8  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-11-11.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
$
</pre>

      <p>
        To close off this chapter,
        let's look at one more thing SSH can do for us.
        Suppose we want to check whether we have already created the file
        <code>backups/results-2011-11-12.dat</code> on the backup server.
        Instead of logging in and then typing <code>ls</code>,
        we could do this:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ssh vlad@backupserver ls results</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="out">results-2011-09-18.dat  results-2011-10-28.dat
results-2011-10-04.dat  results-2011-11-11.dat</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p class="continue">
        SSH has taken the arguments after our username and the name of the computer we want to run on
        and passed them to the shell on the remote computer.
        Since those arguments are a legal command,
        the remote shell has run <code>ls results</code> for us
        and sent the output back to our local shell for display.
      </p>

      <h2>Creating and Managing Keys</h2>

      <p>
        Typing in our password every time we want to access a remote machine is more than a minor annoyance.
        Imagine what would happen if we wanted to run a program on a remote machine
        for all combinations of three different parameters.
        We want to do something like this:
      </p>

<pre>
for density in {20..29}
do
  for viscosity in 0.70 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74
  do
    for temperature in 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 0.005
    do
      ssh vlad@fastmachine ./simulation -x -d $density -v $viscosity -v $temperature
    done
  done
done
</pre>
  
      <p class="continue">
        If we actually try to do this, though,
        we will have to sit at our keyboard and type in our password 250 times.
        What we want is a way to authenticate ourselves to the remote computer automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can do this using a technique borrowed from <a class="gdef" href="gloss.html#public-key-cryptography">public key cryptography</a>.
        More specifically,
        we will create a <a class="gdef" href="gloss.html#key-pair">key pair</a>
        consisting of a <a class="gdef" href="gloss.html#public-key">public key</a>
        and a <a class="gdef" href="gloss.html#private-key">private key</a>.
        These keys have two interesting properties:
      </p>

      <ol>

        <li>
          Anything that one encrypts, the other can decrypt.
          For example, if we encrypt our password with the private key,
          only the public key can decrypt it,
          while if we encrypt the contents of a file with the public key,
          only the private key can decrypt it.
        </li>

        <li>
          Given one key, it is practically impossible to find the other,
          where "practically impossible" means
          "can't be done in the expected lifetime of the universe using any computer we can conceive of"
          (though quantum computing may one day change that&mdash;consult your nearest wild-eyed physicist for details).
        </li>

      </ol>

      <p>
        Once we have created a key pair,
        we can put the public key on the remote machine we want access to,
        and keep the private key on our local machine.
        So long as they are where SSH expects them to be,
        it will use them instead of asking us for a password.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first step is to create the key pair,
        which we do using <code>ssh-keygen</code>:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ssh-keygen -t rsa</span>
<span class="out">Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/users/vlad/.ssh/id_rsa):</span> <span class="in">&#8629;</span>
<span class="out">Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):</span> <span class="in">&#8629;</span>
<span class="out">Your identification has been saved in /users/vlad/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /users/vlad/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is: d3:1a:27:38:aa:54:e8:a5:03:db:79:2f:b2:c3:c9:3d</span>
$
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        The <code>-t rsa</code> option tells <code>ssh-keygen</code> to create an RSA key;
        there are other types, but this one is the most commonly used.
        The "&#8629;" character indicates a carriage return:
        we want to put the key in the default location so that SSH will know where to find it,
        and we don't want a passphrase (since the whole point is to be able to log in without typing a password),
        so we just type enter in response to both questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's look in the <code>.ssh</code> directory under our home directory:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="input">cd</span>
$ <span class="input">ls .ssh</span>
<span class="output">id_rsa  id_rsa.pub</span>
$
</pre>

      <p>
        The first file, <code>id_rsa</code>, contains our private key.
        Never put this on a remote machine,
        send it by email,
        or share it with anyone
        (unless you really want them to be able to impersonate you).
        The other file, <code>id_rsa.pub</code>,
        contains the matching public key.
        Let's copy it onto the remote machine we want to access:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub vlad@fastmachine:id_rsa.pub</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="out">id_rsa.pub              100%  1  1.0 MB/s 00:00</span>
$
</pre>

      <p>
        We still have to type our password because
        the public key isn't in the right place on the remote machine
        when we run <code>scp</code>.
        Let's take care of that
        by logging into the remote machine
        and creating a <code>.ssh</code> directory there:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">ssh vlad@fastmachine</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="highlight">$ <span class="in">mkdir .ssh</span>
$</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        The next step is to copy the public key into a file in the <code>.ssh</code> directory
        called <code>authorized_keys</code>:
      </p>

<pre>
<span class="highlight">$ <span class="in">cp id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys</span>
$</span>
</pre>

      <p>
        The final step is to make sure that permissions are set properly
        on <code>.ssh</code> and <code>authorized_keys</code>.
        This is an extra security measure:
        if anyone but us can read or modify them,
        SSH will assume that they aren't secure any longer.
        The right permissions are:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          owner has read, write, and execute for the <code>.ssh</code> directory;
        </li>

        <li>
          owner has read and write for <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>; and
        </li>

        <li>
          nobody has anything else.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="continue">
        The correct commands are:
      </p>

<pre>
<span class="highlight">$ <span class="in">chmod u=rwx,g=,o= .ssh</span>
$ <span class="in">chmod u=rw,g=,o= .ssh/authorized_keys</span>
$</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        We're all set.
        Let's exit from the remote shell and try running a command
        to see if everything is working:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="highlight"><span class="in">exit</span></span>
$ <span class="in">ssh vlad@fastmachine pwd</span>
<span class="out">/home/vlad</span>
$
</pre>

      <p>
        Here is what is on both machines after we created and installed the keys:
      </p>

      <img src="img/web/public-private-keys.png" alt="Public/Private Keys" />

      <p>
        We can now run <code>ssh</code> (and <code>scp</code>) from our local machine
        to the remote machine without having to authenticate every time.
        This only works one way, though:
        having the public key installed in the remote machine's <code>authorized_keys</code> file
        does <em>not</em> give that machine permission to log in to our local machine.
        If we wanted to do that,
        we would have to generate a key pair on the remote machine
        and copy its <code>id_rsa.pub</code> to our local <code>authorized_keys</code> file.
      </p>

      <p>
        What if we want to connect to a machine from several other machines?
        For example,
        suppose we want to be able to copy files to and from the backup server from our laptop,
        our desktop computer,
        and the machine in the lab.
        To handle this,
        we add each machine's <code>id_rsa.pub</code> file
        to the remote machine's <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file.
        We can do this with an editor,
        or more simply use <code>cat</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to append one file to another:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">scp id_rsa.pub vlad@backupserver</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
$ <span class="in">ssh vlad@backupserver</span>
<span class="out">Password:</span><span class="in"> ********</span>
<span class="highlight">$ <span class="in">cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys</span>
$ <span class="in">rm id_rsa.pub</span>
$ <span class="in">exit</span></span>
$
</pre>

      <h2>Subversion Repositories Revisited</h2>

      <p>
        Now let's see how to create a repository on a server.
        We'll assume that we have a Unix shell account on a server called <code>monstrous.monsters.org</code>,
        and that our home directory is <code>/u/mummy</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To create a repository called <code>lair</code>,
        we log into that computer using SSH,
        then run <code>svnadmin create lair_repo</code>.
        (Once again, we would probably actually create a sub-directory called something like <code>repos</code>
        and put our repository in there,
        but we'll skip that step here to keep our URLs short.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The URL for the repository we just created is <code>monstrous.monsters.org/u/mummy/lair</code>,
        except that's not a complete URL,
        because it doesn't specify the protocol we are going to use to connect to the repository.
        It's very common to use the HTTP protocol to communicate with Subversion,
        but setting that up requires some knowledge of how web servers work,
        and permission to change the web server's configuration.
        Instead,
        we will use a combination of two protocols to access our repository:
        SSH (which gives us secure connections)
        and SVN (which is how Subversion moves information back and forth).
        Putting them together,
        the full URL for our repository is <code>svn+ssh://mummy@monstrous.monsters.org/u/mummy/lair</code>.
        Breaking this back into pieces for review:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <code>svn+ssh</code> is the protocol.
          (It has to be spelled exactly this way: "ssh+svn" should work, but doesn't.)
        </li>

        <li>
          <code>mummy@monstrous.monsters.org</code> specifies who we are
          and what machine we're connecting to.
        </li>

        <li>
          <code>/u/mummy/lair</code> is where our repository is located.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="contiue">
        Every Subversion repository URL has these parts:
        a protocol,
        something to identify the server
        (which may optionally include a user ID if the repository isn't publicly readable),
        and a path.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's switch back to our local machine and check out a copy of the repository.
        When we run Subversion's <code>checkout</code> command,
        our client makes a connection to the server <code>monstrous.monsters.org</code>
        and then prompts us for the password associated with the <code>mummy</code> account.
        By entering this password,
        we are proving to the server that we are the user <code>mummy</code>,
        or at least that we have the right to read and write the files that belong to <code>mummy</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice that our client gives us the option of saving our password locally,
        so that we don't have to re-enter it each time we update from or commit to this repository.
        If we have created a <a href="fixme#s:keys">key pair</a>
        and installed the public key on the server,
        the SSH part of the svn+ssh protocol will use that instead of asking for a password.

      <h2>Job Control</h2>
  
      <p>
        Our next topic is how to control programs <em>once they're running</em>.
        This is called <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#job-control">job control</a>,
        and while it's less important today than it was back in the Dark Ages,
        it is coming back into its own as more people begin to leverage the power of computer networks.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        When we talk about controlling programs,
        what we really mean is controlling <em>processes</em>.
        As we said earlier, a process is just a program that's in memory and executing.
        Some of the processes on your computer are yours:
        they're running programs you explicitly asked for, like your web browser.
        Many others belong to the operating system that manages your computer for you, or, if you're on a shared machine, to other users.
        You can use the <code>ps</code> command to list them, just as you use <code>ls</code> to list files and directories:

        Every process has a unique process id (PID).
        Remember, this is a property of the process, not of the program that process is executing:
        if you are running three instances of your browser at once, each will have its own process ID.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The second column in this listing, PPID, shows the ID of each process's parent.
        Every process on a computer is spawned by another, which is its parent
        (except, of course, for the bootstrap process that runs automatically when the computer starts up).
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The third column (labelled PGID) is the ID of the <em>process group</em> this process belongs to.
        We won't discuss process groups in this lecture,
        but they're often used to manage sets of related processes.
        Column 4 shows the ID of the terminal this process is running in.
        Once upon a time, this really would have been a terminal connected to a central timeshared computer.
        It isn't as important these days, except that if a process is a system service, such as a network monitor,
        <code>ps</code> will display a question mark for its terminal, since it doesn't actually have one.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Column 5 is more interesting: it's the user ID of the user this process is being run by.
        This is the user ID the computer uses when checking permissions:
        the process is allowed to access exactly the same things as the user, no more, no less.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Finally, Column 6 shows when the process started running,
        and Column 7 shows what program the process is executing.
        Your version of <code>ps</code> may show more or fewer columns,
        or may show them in a different order,
        but the same information is generally available everywhere.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The shell provides several commands for stopping, pausing, and resuming processes.
        To see them in action, let's run our <code>analyze</code> program on our latest data files.
        After a few minutes go by, we realize that this is going to take a while to finish.
        Being impatient, we kill the process by typing <span class="in">Control-C</span>.
        This stops the currently-executing program right away.
        Any results it had calculated, but not written to disk, are lost.
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">./analyze results*.dat</span>
<span class="out">...a few minutes pass...
^C</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        Let's run that same command again,
        with an ampersand <code>&amp;</code> at the end of the line to tell the shell we want it to run in the <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#background">background</a>:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">./analyze results*.dat &amp;</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        When we do this, the shell launches the program as before.
        Instead of leaving our keyboard and screen connected to the program's standard input and output, though, the shell hangs onto them.
        This means the shell can give us a fresh command prompt, and start running other commands, right away.
        Here, for example, we're putting some parameters for the next run of the program in a file:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">cat &gt; params.txt
density: 22.0
viscosity: 0.75
^D</span>
$
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        (Remember, <span class="in">^D</span> is the shell's way of showing <span class="in">Control-D</span>,
        which means "end of input".)
        Now let's run the <code>jobs</code> command,
        which tells us what processes are currently running in the background:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">jobs</span>
<span class="out">[1] ./analyze results01.dat results02.dat results03.dat</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        Since we're about to go and get coffee, we might as well use the foreground command, <code>fg</code>,
        to bring our background job into the foreground:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">fg</span>
<span class="out">...a few minutes pass...</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p class="continue">
        When <code>analyze</code> finishes running, the shell gives us a fresh prompt as usual.
        If we had several jobs running in the background,
        we could control which one we brought to the foreground using <code>fg %1</code>, <code>fg %2</code>, and so on.
        The IDs are <em>not</em> the process IDs.
        Instead, they are the job IDs displayed by the <code>jobs</code> command.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The shell gives us one more tool for job control:
        if a process is already running in the foreground,
        <span class="in">Control-Z</span> will pause it and return control to the shell.
        We can then use <code>fg</code> to resume it in the foreground,
        or <code>bg</code> to resume it as a background job.
        For example, let's run <code>analyze</code> again, and then type <span class="in">Control-Z</span>.
        The shell immediately tells us that our program has been stopped, and gives us its job number:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">./analyze results01.dat</span>
<span class="out">^Z
[1]  Stopped   ./analyze results01.dat</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p class="continue">
        If we type <code>bg %1</code>, the shell starts the process running again, but in the background.
        We can check that it's running using <code>jobs</code>,
        and kill it while it's still in the background using <code>kill</code> and the job number.
        This has the same effect as bringing it to the foreground and then typing <span class="in">Control-C</span>:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bg %1</span>
$ <span class="in">jobs</span>
<span class="out">[1] ./analyze results01.dat</span>
$ <span class="in">kill %1</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        Job control was important when users only had one terminal window at a time.
        It's less important now: if we want to run another program, it's easy enough to open another window and run it there.
        However, these ideas and tools are making a comeback,
        as they're often the easiest way to run and control programs on remote computers elsewhere on the network.
        We'll look at how to do this <a href="#s:ssh">later in this chapter</a>.

    <section id="s:var">
  
      <h2>Variables</h2>
  
      <p>
        The shell is just a program, and like other programs, it has variables.
        Those variables control its execution, and by changing their values, you can change how the shell and other programs behave.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Let's start by running the command <code>set</code> and looking at some of the variables in a typical shell session:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">set</span>
<span class="out">COMPUTERNAME=TURING
HOME=/home/vlad
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOSTNAME=TURING
HOSTTYPE=i686
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4
OS=Windows_NT
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/cygdrive/c/Windows/system32:/cygdrive/c/Windows:/cygdrive/c/bin:/cygdrive/c/Python27
PWD=/home/vlad
UID=1000
USERNAME=vlad
    &#8942;        &#8942;        &#8942;</span>
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        As you can see, there are quite a few&mdash;in fact, four or five times more than what's shown on this slide.
        And yes,
        using <code>set</code> to <em>show</em> things might seem a little strange,
        even for Unix,
        but if you don't give it any arguments,
        it might as well show you things you <em>could</em> set.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Every variable has a name.
        By convention, variables that are always present are given upper-case names.
        All shell variables' values are strings, even those (like <code>UID</code>) that look like numbers.
        it's up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary.
        For example, if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had,
        it would convert the value of the <code>NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS</code> variable from a string to an integer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, some variables (like <code>PATH</code>) store lists of values.
        In this case, the convention is to use a colon ':' as a separator.
        If a program wants the individual elements of such a list,
        it's the program's responsibility to split the variable's string value into pieces.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Let's have a closer look at that <code>PATH</code> variable.
        Its value defines the shell's <a class="dfn" href="glossary.html#search-path">search path</a>,
        i.e., the directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs.
        If you recall, when we type a command like <code>./analyze</code> that has a specific directory in the path,
        the shell runs the program that path specifies.
        Similarly, if we type <code>/bin/analyze</code>, the shell runs that specific program:
        we've provided a specific path, so it knows what to do.
        But which one should the shell do if we just type <code>analyze</code>?
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The rule is simple:
        the shell checks each directory in the <code>PATH</code> variable in turn,
        looking for a program with the rqeuested name in that directory.
        As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        To show how this works, here are the components of <code>PATH</code> broken out one per line:
      </p>

<pre>
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/cygdrive/c/Windows/system32
/cygdrive/c/Windows
/cygdrive/c/bin
/cygdrive/c/Python27
</pre>
  
      <p>
        On our computer, there are actually three programs called <code>analyze</code> in three different directories:
        <code>/bin/analyze</code>, <code>/usr/local/bin/analyze</code>, and <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code>.
        Since the shell searches the directories in order, it finds the one in <code>/bin</code>, not either of the others.
        Notice that it will <em>never</em> find the program <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code>,
        since the directory <code>/users/vlad</code> isn't in our path.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Before we explore variables any further, let's introduce one more command: <code>echo</code>.
        All it does is print out its arguments.
        This doesn't sound very exciting, but we can use it to show variables' values.
        First, let's make sure it works:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">echo hello transylvania!</span>
<span class="out">hello transylvania!</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p class="continue">
        Now let's try to show the value of the variable <code>HOME</code>:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">echo HOME</span>
<span class="out">HOME</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p class="continue">
        That just prints "HOME", which isn't what we wanted.
        Let's try this instead: <code>echo $HOME</code>:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">echo $HOME</span>
<span class="out">/home/vlad</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        The dollar sign tells the shell to replace the variable's name with its value.
        This works just like wildcards:
        the shell does the replacement <em>before</em> running the program we've asked for.
        Thanks to this expansion, what we actually run is <code>echo /home/vlad</code>,
        which displays the right thing.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Creating a variable is easy: just assign a value to a name using "=":
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula</span>
$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
<span class="out">Dracula</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p class="continue">
        To change the value, just assign a new one:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">SECRET_IDENTITY=Camilla</span>
$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
<span class="out">Camilla</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        Now for the complicated bit.
        Assignment only changes a variable's value in the current shell,
        not in any other shells that are currently running,
        or in any shells that are started later.
        To see what this means,
        let's go back and set our secret identity once again:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula</span>
$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
<span class="out">Dracula</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p class="continue">
        Once it's set, let's run a fresh copy of the shell by typing the command <code>bash</code>.
        Remember, the shell is just another program:
        asking it to run a fresh instance of itself in a new process is no different
        from asking it to run <code>ls</code>, <code>ps</code>, or anything else.
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        Nothing seems to have happened,
        but we now have two copies of the shell running.
        We don't see anything signalling this on the screen because the new shell prints the same prompt as the old one,
        but our keyboard input and screen output are now tied to the child shell.
      </p>

      <img src="../img/shell/shell-on-shell.png" alt="Running a Shell from the Shell" />

      <p class="continue">
        If we <code>echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</code> in the child shell,
        nothing is printed, because the variable doesn't have a value in the child shell:
        it was only set in the original shell.
        But if we exit the child shell and return to the original, we can see that yes, the variable does exist.
        Here's the whole sequence of commands
        with the ones executed in the child shell highlighted:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula</span>
$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
<span class="out">Dracula</span>
$ <span class="in">bash</span>
<span class="highlight">$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
$ <span class="in">exit</span></span>
$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
<span class="out">Dracula</span>
$
</pre>
  
      <p>
        If we really want the shell to pass a variable to the processes it creates,
        we must use the <code>export</code> command.
        Let's try the secret identity example again.
        After giving <code>SECRET_IDENTITY</code> a value,
        we give the shell the command <code>export SECRET_IDENTITY</code>:
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula</span>
$ <span class="in">export SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
$
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        Note that it's <em>not</em> <code>export $SECRET_IDENTITY</code> with a dollar sign:
        if we typed that, the shell would expand <code>SECRET_IDENTITY</code>,
        and our <code>export</code> command would actually be <code>export Dracula</code>,
        which would do nothing,
        because there's no variable called <code>Dracula</code>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Now let's run a new shell, and type <code>echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</code>.
        There's our variable.
        And of course, exiting brings us back to our original shell.
      </p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">bash</span>
<span class="highlight">$ <span class="in">echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</span>
<span class="out">Dracula</span>
$ <span class="in">exit</span></span>
$
</pre>

  
      <p>
        If we want to set some variables' values automatically every time we run a shell,
        we can put the command to do this in a file called <code>.bashrc</code> in our home directory.
        (The '.' character at the front prevents <code>ls</code> from listing this file
        unless we specifically ask it to using <code>-a</code>:
        we normally don't want to worry about it.
        The "rc" at the end is an abbreviation for "run control",
        which meant something really important decades ago,
        and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.)
        For example, here are two lines in Vlad's <code>.bashrc</code> file,
        which is in <code>/home/vlad/.bashrc</code>:
      </p>

<pre>
export SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
export TEMP_DIR=/tmp
export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        These two lines create the variables <code>SECRET_IDENTITY</code> and <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>,
        give them values,
        and export them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well.
        Notice that <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>'s definition relies on the value of <code>TEMP_DIR</code>,
        so that if we change where we put temporary files,
        our backups will be relocated automatically.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        While we're here, it's also common to use the <code>alias</code> command to create shortcuts for things we frequently type.
        For example, we can define the alias <code>backup</code>
        to run <code>/bin/zback</code> with a specific set of arguments:
      </p>

<pre>
alias backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 $HOME $BACKUP_DIR
</pre>

      <p class="continue">
        As you can see, aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes.
