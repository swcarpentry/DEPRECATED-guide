========================================

Elizabeth Patitsas (a grad student in Computer Science at the
University of Toronto with an interest in CS education) looked at the
questions I’d written for the Python section of the Software Carpentry
instructors' guide. Her main comment was, "You need to have multiple
styles of questions, probing multiple levels and types of
understanding. Right now you just probe recognition of behavior." This
relates directly to the multiple-choice questions I asked people to
write for Round 2.4, so on the "better late than never" principle,
here are her suggestions for improvements:

----------------------------------------

Greg has the code:

    x = 2 * y

And when he prints x, he gets 26. What is the value of y?

*This probes backtracing rather than your linear style of reasoning forward from code to output.*

----------------------------------------

Greg has the code:

    >>> oxygen = 'O'
    >>> carbon = 'C
    >>> molecule = carbon + oxygen * 2

Why does molecule get the value ‘COO'?

*Turns this into a reflection question (why) rather than a prediction question (what happens after it is run?)*

----------------------------------------

Greg has the code:

    pi = 3.14
    x = str(pi)

which turns pi into a string.

Rewrite the second line so it turns x into an integer instead.

*This tests transfer of knowledge: rewriting code.
Transfer is a very important skill for people to hone when programming.*

----------------------------------------

Greg has the following code:

    handle = open('square.txt', 'r')
    result = len(handle)
    handle.close()
    print result

At the end of what line in the code does Python stop reading the content from square.txt?

*This probes a ‘where' question (locating), another way of reflecting on code.*

----------------------------------------

Greg has this code:

    text = 'abc'
    for char in text:
	 text = text + char
    print text

Fill in the table below (not shown) of the value of text for each iteration of the for loop.

*This is a tracing question.*

----------------------------------------

What single change can be made to the first three lines below to get the output shown?


    >>> scaling = 10 # line 1
    >>> original = 7 # line 2
    >>> adjusted = primary / scaling # line 3
    >>> print original + adjusted # line 4
    7.7

*Omit the MCQ options and just make it fill in the blank: test recall rather than recognition.*

----------------------------------------

If species.txt is a text file, what do the following lines print?

    info = open('species.txt', 'r')
    print info.readline().strip()

Why does Greg need the second line for him to process the file?

*This here gets at conceptual knowledge, testing function rather than the behavior of the program.*

----------------------------------------

Greg has the code:

    results = open('output.txt', 'w')
    results.write('first')
    results.close()
    results = open('output.txt', 'a')
    results.write('second')
    results.close()

What is another way to write this code so the same effect is accomplished, but in fewer lines?

*This tests a students' ability to generate different approaches. (In this case, opening the file as ‘rw' allows for less code.)*

----------------------------------------

Greg has the code:

    >>> female = 'GGT'
    >>> male = 'CAC'
    >>> female = female + female + male
    >>> print female
    GGTGGTCAC

Elizabeth has the code:

    >>> female = 'GGT'
    >>> male = 'CAC'
    >>> female = 2 * female + male
    >>> print female
    GGTGGTCAC

Both have the same effect. Why would use Elizabeth's approach instead of Greg's?

*This tests a student's ability to compare different solution approaches.*

----------------------------------------

A final note from Elizabeth: procedural flexibility (transferring a
problem to an isomorphic one, generating new ways of solving a
problem, evaluating different ways of solving a problem) is something
she found in her MSc thesis to be important for long-term learning of
Python as well as to be highly correlated to conceptual
knowledge. This is generally easier to probe in short answer/MCQ
questions than conceptual knowledge.
